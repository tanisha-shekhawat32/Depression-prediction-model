A machine learning web application that predicts the risk of depression in students using behavioral and academic data. Built with a Flask backend and HTML frontend.

---

## 📌 Features

- 🧠 Predicts *student depression risk* (Low / High)
- ✅ Uses a *Random Forest Classifier*
- 🌐 Frontend hosted on *GitHub Pages*
- 📦 Python-powered backend using *Flask + Scikit-learn*
- 💾 Local .csv dataset and pre-trained model support

🧠 About the Model

Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Input: Student behavior & academic-related features

Output: Depression risk classification

Trained using scikit-learn with preprocessing and label encoding



---

🗃 Dataset Info

Ensure that the file student_depression_dataset.csv is present in the root folder.
The dataset should contain features like attendance, GPA, screen time, sleep patterns, etc.
